	<p> My name is Mahalia and I am a senior at Princeton University. I will graduate in May of 2024 with a B.A. in the History of Science. Alonside my History of Science Degree, I have studied film, screenwriting, filmmaking, visual art and television production in my time at Princeton. I have also spent substantial time studying Spanish and using it outside of class. I have spent the past two summers in Spain, once for an internship, and once to conduct research for my thesis. In my capstone thesis project I am currently working to combine these disciplines to research the relationship between history and film in Spain over the 20th century.  
        </p>
	<p>I have strong interests in filmmaking and storytelling, photography, and drawing. I hope to continue to combine my artistic impulses with my harworking nature to create art in community with others. I am always looking to collaborate on new projects and ideas. I am a person of many skills, and I am still working to define my role in the creative process. I am passionate about art that addresses issues of intersectional feminism and co-liberation as we look toward sharing a sustainable future together. </p>
