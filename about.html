	<p> My name is Mahalia and I am a young filmmaker. I recently graduated from Princeton University with a B.A. in the History of Science. Alongside my History of Science Degree, I have studied film, screenwriting, filmmaking, visual art and television production. I produced two short films this year, and I am currently in pre-production for a third. Thus far I am practiced in the art of narrative film, montage, and video collage (see 'Portfolio'), but I am constantly trying to develop new skills. Outside of film and history I have also spent substantial time studying Spanish and using it outside of class. In my capstone thesis project I combined these disciplines to research the relationship between history and film in Spain over the 20th century (see 'Writing'). At this stage in my development I am seeking work and experience on film sets and I look forward to continuing my education outside of the classroom!  
        </p>
	<p> I am always looking to collaborate on new projects and ideas. If you have an idea for a project you would like to share with me, please don't hesitate to <a href="contact.html">contact me.</a> I am especially eager to work on projects which combine social justice and multiple persepctives with the medium of filmmaking. </p>
